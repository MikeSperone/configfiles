## This is specific to my computer
I'm starting to add more general considerations to allow install everywhere (OSX, Linux, Windows) since I would like to be able to use this for any computer and any environment.
But you should browse the .sh scripts and files to confirm files and locations, etc... I haven't yet been able to run this on a new system without making changes.

## install will overwrite your files!!
to install run:  `./install.sh`
